## About Koyeb and the Aim example application

Koyeb is a developer-friendly serverless platform to deploy apps globally. No-ops, servers, or infrastructure management.  This repository contains an [Aim](https://aimstack.io/) application written in Python that you can deploy on Koyeb in a single click.

This example application is designed to show how Aim applications can be built and deployed on Koyeb.  The example application is a simple metadata task adapted from the [Aim quick start guide](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start/setup.html).  It executes a simple tracking exercise and then runs the web UI for interactive exploration.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to deploy and run the Aim application on your Koyeb account.

### Requirements

You need a Koyeb account to successfully deploy and run this application. If you don't already have an account, you can sign-up for free [here](https://app.koyeb.com/auth/signup).

### Deploy using the Koyeb button

The fastest way to deploy the Aim application is to click the **Deploy to Koyeb** button below.
